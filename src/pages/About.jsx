        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Dillar English Academy was founded by Dilnawa and Dilziba Dilmurat 
            Kizghin to help Uyghurs around the world learn English without cost. 
            With the help and commitment of our volunteer teachers, our goal is 
            to bridge the educational disparity gap among Uyghurs worldwide.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Dillar Academy has grown exponentially in a short time! Recognizing a 
            need in the international Uyghur community, we have recruited Uyghur 
            college students in America to volunteer their time and teach various 
            levels of English. Although our teachers are not certified English 
            language instructors, they are native English speakers who invest 
            time into teaching the best information that they can.</p>
