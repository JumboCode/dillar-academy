  "about_body1": "Dillar Academy has grown exponentially in a short time! Recognizing a need in the international Uyghur community, we have recruited Uyghur college students in America to volunteer their time and teach various levels of English. Although our teachers are not certified English language instructors, they are native English speakers who invest time into teaching the best information that they can.",
  "about_body2": "Dillar English Academy was founded by Dilnawa and Dilziba Dilmurat Kizghin to help Uyghurs around the world learn English without cost. With the help and commitment of our volunteer teachers, our goal is to bridge the educational disparity gap among Uyghurs worldwide.",
